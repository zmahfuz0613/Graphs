# Graphs 
When netflix recommends another movie to you or if advertisers target you based off of something... Graphs are usually in play. 

### Today, we will
- explain what a graph is
- Compare and contrast different types of graphs and their use cases in the real world

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(abstract_data_type)

Basically it's a collection of nodes and connections between those nodes.

They are all treated equally.

This is an example of a **wikipedia** and each edge a connection.

### Real world 
- Social Networks 
- Location / Mapping 
- Routing Algorithms 
- Visual Hierarchy
- File System Optimization 
- Everywherer!!

### Graph terms 
- **Vertex** - a node 
- **Edge** - connection between nodes 
- **Weighted/Unweighted** - values assigned to distance
- **Directed/ Undirected** 

Directed is when there is a one way relationship between nodes. 
Weighted is when there are values on the edges. You can think of this as a google map.
